# City Map

Here I discuss the geographical distribution of two parties' supporters in cities. Every city's introduction include two charts:

### Margin Map

Every map represent data by the lowest level of administrative/electoral district, village. The village's color is determined by the average of ten years' voting margin between two major parties. KMT is blud while DPP is green. The darker the color, the higher the margin, and the stronger support to the party.

### Margin Line Chart by Year

## Taipei

Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. Most major business and political activities happen here. The residents in Taipei usually have higher socioeconomical background and education level.

Da-dao-cheng(大稻埕), the old town area in the west side of city, inclines to DPP by a small margin while the whole city usually vote for KMT in general. The residents in Da-dao-cheng are so-called "Old Taipei People", living in Taipei since a hundred years ago, in the era under Japan's governance. The earliest democracy campaigns in Taiwan were initiated here.

The lower small districts are the downtown of Taipei. The residents here are government employees, school teachers and middle-class white-collar workers, on the appearance. These occupations are highly correlated with mainlander who migrated to Taiwan since KMT and Chiang's retreat to Taiwan in 1949. The mainlanders benefited from the governance system largely and, hence, tend to support KMT.

## New Taipei City

New Taipei City plays a role as Taipei's satellite city. As Taiwan's economic growth boomed in 1950-1960, more business activities and jobs appeared in Taipei. More and more people came to the capital from the island's every corner for jobs and making money. The rent and property price is high in the city, so people went to its neighbor, New Taipei City, for fair rent and more space. These within-islander immigrants formed various communities in New Taipei City and each have their own special characteristics.
