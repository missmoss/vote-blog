            "title": "Does Incumbency Advantage Exist In Taiwan's Legislator Elections?",
            "content": "Incumbency advantage . People usually believe the incumbent candidate has a higher winning rate in the re-election. Does the incumbent effect still exist when we extend it to the party level? That is, whether a candidate has a higher winning probability while the seat/office was won by their party last time. . Measure the incumbency advantage effect: regression discontinuity . To measure the incumbent effect, Lee 1 proposed a regression discontinuity design on previous election margins. The design studied the observations near the cut-off, margin equals zero in this case, and saw if there was a significant difference in the winning probability between the samples with its previous margin less than zero, says losing last time, and the samples winning last time. Since only the observations with near zero margin are studied and the margin is so small that it probably won just by chance, whether a party won the previous election can be conisdered as almost randomly assigned. Hence, the difference between the two sides is the effect we are curious about. Lee found the incumbency advantage existed in representative elections in US. Does the same incumbent effect can be found in Taiwan&#39;s legislator elections? . . Lee, D. S. (2008). Randomized experiments from non-random selection in US House elections. Journal of Econometrics, 142(2), 675-697.&#8617; . | Taiwan&#39;s legislator elections . The legislators are the parliament members at the national level. They can propose general law creation and modification. They also supervise the goverment. The legislators are elected every four year. The candidate . There are 113 seats of legislators in total: . Regional: 73 seats. Single-member districts. | Party: 34 seats. Party-list proportional representation voting. | Indigenous: 6 seats. Single non-transferable voting in multi-member districts, exclusive for persons with indigenous status. | The electoral district and method design has been effective since 2008. The previous elections were hold under multiple-member districts so I didn&#39;t include them in the data. There are four elections, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020, in the data. However, the districts and seats are totally different in 2004 and 2008 because of the electoral district and method change. In this RD design, we need current and previous election results together as a full record. Hence, 2008 result is only used as 2012&#39;s last-time result as table below but doesn&#39;t appear as current records in the data. . current previous . 2012 | 2008 | . 2016 | 2012 | . 2020 | 2016 | . Two major parties . Most elections in Taiwan are competed by two major parties, KMT and DPP, though there are over one hundred parties regiested and around ten of them are active. KMT is pro-China and relatively consevative while DPP is pro-independent and more progressive. . KMT&#39;s view . Let&#39;s start from KMT. The distribution of 188 records are show as below. Most winning candidates were in a electoral district KMT won last time. . #collapse-hide dt %&gt;% filter(!is.na(margin_all_KMT_pos_last)) %&gt;% mutate(KMT_elected = ifelse(KMT_elected == TRUE, &quot;KMT Won&quot;, &quot;KMT Lose&quot;)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = margin_all_KMT_pos_last), fill = &quot;#7986CB&quot;, bins = 30) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = &quot;#CC9423&quot;, size = 0.8) + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + labs(x = &quot;KMT&#39;s margin in previous election&quot;, title = &quot;KMT&#39;s Election Results in 2012-2020 v.

RD Plot: All Groups . To check its regression discontinuity, the data has to be aggregated into groups and calculated their average winning rate. I grouped the data into quantile-spaced (QS) bins.1 QS makes sure every group containing equal number of records and helps us to observe data&#39;s distribution on the plot as well. As we can see on the plot below, previous margins locate a lot between -15% ~ 15%. The regression line has a steep slope on the side of KMT won the previous election.

            "content": "Introduction . Two major parties dominate Taiwan’s political stage. One is Kuomintang (KMT), alternatively translated as Chinese Nationalist Party, once the monopoly dominant party ruling under martial law in Taiwan for 38 years until 1988. KMT is pro-China, relatively conservative on social issues. The other is Democractic Progress Party (DPP), was originally founded during the martial law era when competing parties were illegal, now is pro-independence from China and relatively progressive on human rights and equality issues. . A Glance at the Two Parties . Geographically, DPP usually win majority votes in southern cities, such as Tainan and Pingtung, while KMT win northern and eastern cities, from Taipei, Hualien to Taitung. In demographical view, government employees, military workers and teachers are considered as KMT’s solid supporters because of the party’s lucrative welfare policy for these groups. DPP was seen as a grass root party with its supporters from blue-collar workers and taxi drivers in early years. After Tsai Ing-Wen, Taiwan’s first female president and DPP’s chairwoman at that time, took office in 2016, DPP developed a stable strategy in security and diplomacy. The party has since then built a more elite image once held by KMT. . (More background and history here) . Elections . (Taiwan’s election design) . Electoral District .

            "content": "City Map . Here I discuss the geographical distribution of two parties’ supporters in cities. Every city’s introduction include two charts: . Margin Map . Every map represents data by the lowest level of administrative/electoral district, village. The village’s color is determined by the average of ten years’ voting margin between two major parties. KMT is blud while DPP is green. The darker the color, the higher the margin, and the stronger support to the party. . . Margin Line Chart by Year . Taipei . Taipei is the capital of Taiwan. Most major business and political activities happen here. The residents in Taipei usually have higher socioeconomical background and education level. . . Da-dao-cheng(大稻埕), the old town area in the west side of city, inclines to DPP by a small margin while the whole city usually vote for KMT in general. The residents in Da-dao-cheng are so-called “Old Taipei People”, living in Taipei since a hundred years ago, in the era under Japan’s governance. The earliest democracy campaigns in Taiwan were initiated here. . The lower small districts are the downtown of Taipei. The residents here are government employees, school teachers and middle-class white-collar workers, on the appearance. These occupations are highly correlated with mainlander who migrated to Taiwan since KMT and Chiang’s retreat to Taiwan in 1949. The mainlanders benefited from the governance system largely and, hence, tend to support KMT. . New Taipei City . New Taipei City plays a role as Taipei’s satellite city. As Taiwan’s economic growth boomed in 1950-1960, more business activities and jobs appeared in Taipei. More and more people came to the capital from the island’s every corner for jobs and making money. The rent and property price is high in the city, so people went to its neighbor, New Taipei City, for fair rent and more space. These within-islander immigrants formed various communities in New Taipei City and each have their own special characteristics. . .",
